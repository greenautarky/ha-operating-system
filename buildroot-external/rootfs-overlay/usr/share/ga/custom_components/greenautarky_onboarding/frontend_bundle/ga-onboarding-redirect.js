/**
 * greenautarky onboarding — client-side redirect to the setup wizard.
 *
 * Injected into the Home Assistant frontend via
 * `frontend.add_extra_js_url()`. When GA onboarding is not yet completed,
 * it sends the browser to /greenautarky-setup.html.
 *
 * This replaces the server-side `/` redirect that used to live as an
 * IndexView patch in the greenautarky/ha-core fork. The middleware
 * approach (v0.1.x) does not work from a custom_component — aiohttp
 * freezes the middleware list before custom integrations set up
 * (see ga-ihost-docs/MIGRATION-CUSTOM-COMPONENT-FINDINGS.md, Finding 20).
 *
 * Trade-off vs. the server-side patch: the HA frontend bundle starts
 * loading before this redirect fires, so the user may see a brief flash
 * of the HA UI before landing on the wizard. Acceptable for onboarding.
