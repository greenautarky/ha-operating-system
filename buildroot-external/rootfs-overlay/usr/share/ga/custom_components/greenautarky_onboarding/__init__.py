"""Integration for greenautarky post-onboarding setup wizard.

Phase 2 onboarding: the built frontend Lit panel is served at
/greenautarky-setup.html (like stock onboarding.html). A sidebar panel
is also registered so the wizard is accessible from the mobile app.
Handles user account creation, GDPR consent, and analytics preferences.

After onboarding, manages consent re-confirmation via HA repairs system.

This is the custom_component form of the integration. It used to live as a
built-in component in our HA Core fork (greenautarky/ha-core branch
ga/custom-onboarding); migrated 2026-05-XX to decouple from HA Core
lifecycle. See ga-ihost-docs/MIGRATION-CUSTOM-COMPONENT.md.

Two changes vs. the built-in version that lived in the fork:
1. Frontend assets (HTML + JS bundles) are bundled inside this component
   and registered via `async_register_static_paths` — they used to be
   shipped via the GA-customized home-assistant-frontend PyPI package.
2. The `/` → `/greenautarky-setup.html` redirect was a patch to
   `frontend/__init__.py` `IndexView.get()` in the fork; it is now a
   client-side JS module injected via `frontend.add_extra_js_url`.
   (The aiohttp-middleware approach tried in v0.1.x does not work from
   a custom_component — the middleware list is frozen by setup time;
   see ga-ihost-docs/MIGRATION-CUSTOM-COMPONENT-FINDINGS.md Finding 20.)

    Why we have to monkey-patch instead of registering our own `/` view:
    `frontend` is a hard dependency of this integration, so by the time
    we call `_async_setup_common` the frontend integration has already
    registered IndexView at `/` and aiohttp resolves that route first.

    Why the existing `add_extra_js_url`-based redirect isn't enough:
    HA Core injects extra_module_url tags ONLY into the authenticated
    dashboard HTML (see homeassistant.components.frontend.IndexView.get).
    On a fresh device the first hit lands on `/onboarding.html` or
    `/auth/authorize` — neither carries our redirect script, so the
    customer never lands on the GA wizard automatically. Confirmed
    live on KIB-SON-31 bench on BOSv1.2.0 build #6.

    Behavior of the patch:
    - GA wizard incomplete → 302 to /greenautarky-setup.html
    - GA wizard complete → fall through to HA's original IndexView.get
      (which then handles HA-stock onboarding state + dashboard
       authentication as usual)

    Idempotent: marks `IndexView._ga_wizard_patched = True` on the
    class object so re-entry (e.g. an integration reload) doesn't
    re-wrap the already-wrapped method.

    Fleet safety:
    - Already-deployed devices that completed the wizard before this
      code shipped have `completed=True` in storage → patch is a no-op
      (falls through to original IndexView.get).
    - Old devices that never had a stored onboarding state have
      `completed=True` written by default in `_async_setup_common`
      (see the `state is None` branch) → also no-op.
    - The only behavioural change is on devices with
      `completed=False` in storage — which is precisely the "wizard
      pending" state where we WANT the redirect.
